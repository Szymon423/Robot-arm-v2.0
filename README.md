# Robot-arm-v2.0
An attempt to my Masters thesis

Work schedule:
* creating my own system of closed-loop stepper motor control
  - creating test bench ‚úîÔ∏è
  - creating bradboard circuit ‚úîÔ∏è
  - turning breadboard into PCB ‚úîÔ∏è
  - collecting all necessary components ‚úîÔ∏è
  - waiting months for order on JLCPCB (almost here)
  - soldering all components
  - realising that i've made a mistake (hope I didn't)
  - XD.exe
  - repairing shit
  - testing PID control (only P will work better?)
* developing communication between Raspberry pi 4B - Brain of entire system and motor controlling units - Raspberry pi PICO
* developing software for motion controll (maybe via website)
